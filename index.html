                Hello, My name is FAKHRI Mehdi and I am currently studying Interactive Media Design. I am passionate about, web development and game development. I love exploring new tools and digging deeper in the world of programming.                
              </p>

              <p>
                Outside of school, I enjoy playing sports specially volleyball ,and gaming, and spending some alone time reading books, it can go from reading fiction to human psychology. I believe that being curious will always open so much doors for your future and get you alot of opportunities, and to always  stay open-minded. Iam truly looking forward to growing in both my personal life and this unique professional journey.
              </p>
